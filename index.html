            <h3>Basic Information</h3>
            <p>Hello world! My name is <b>Kevin Wang</b>, an ordinary grade 7 student(going into grade 8). I'm
                currently taking a course at Triway Education on Javascript and web design, and this is one of my
                assignments.

            <h3>Computers & Me</h3>
            <p>Ever since I learned that a computer was a thing and that Google Drive existed, I've been pretty into
                computing. I've been learning computing for quite a few years now, and I know how to code in several
                languages. In order of which ones I learned first, I can code a little bit in Python, solve computing
                problems with Java, build somewhat decent-looking webpages using HTML and CSS, create working Apple
                applications using Swift, and now I can make webpages slightly interactive using Javascript. I'm
                strongest in Java, where I'm in Java3 here at Triway, but I haven't learned Java in a long time, so I'm
                a bit rusty.

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>For the most part, I'm just like any other grade 7/8 student. I like reading, writing, playing video
                games, watching Youtube, trains,... all the usual stuff, you know?<br>I really, <em>really</em> like
                to read. I've been reading <em>a lot</em> ever since I've been able to read. I like reading both
                non-fiction and fiction. I used to be a non-fiction addict, devouring massive stacks of books at a
                rate of about a dozen every few weeks, but ever since I started grade 7 and my homework volumes
                skyrocketed, I've been reading less.<br>I like playing video games every now and then, although I
                don't like playing any of those super-popular first-person-shooters like PubG and Fortnite(eww).
                Speaking of games, usually I like to stick with the crowd, do what everyone else is doing, and I
                just don't like getting attention in general. But when it comes to games, I basically hate any games
                that are popular, and I don't like console games either(partly because I don't have a
                console).<br>As you might be able to tell by the amount of text that I've written so far, I like to
                write, and I tend to write a lot at a time.

            <article>
                <p>I don't really have a set of favourite images, but I searched around and came up with a couple images
                    that I think look pretty cool.</p>
